58-I. Forfeiture of property in certain cases.—(1) The competent authority may, after considering the explanation, if any, to the show cause notice issued under section 58H, and the materials available before it and after giving to the person affected and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the notice through any other person, to such other person, also a reasonable opportunity of being heard, by order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties: 

Provided that if the person affected (and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the notice through any other person, such other person also), does not appear before the competent authority or represent his case before it within a period of thirty days specified in the show cause notice, the competent authority may proceed to record a finding under this sub-section ex parte on the basis of evidence available before it.

(2) Where the competent authority is satisfied that some of the properties referred to in the show cause notice are illegally acquired properties but is not able to identify specifically such properties, then, it shall be lawful for the competent authority to specify the properties which, to the best of its judgment, are illegally acquired properties and record a finding accordingly under sub-section (1) within a period of 90 days.

(3) Where the person affected pays the fine due under sub-section (1), within such time as may be allowed in that behalf, the competent authority may, by order revoke the declaration of forfeiture under section 58-I and thereupon such property shall stand released.

58L. Procedure in relation to certain trust properties.—In the case of any person referred to in sub-clause (vi) of clause (b) of section 58B, if the competent authority, on the basis of the information and materials available to it, for reasons to be recorded in writing believes that any property held in trust is illegally acquired property, it may serve a notice upon the author of the trust, or as the case may be, the contributor of the assets out of or by means of which such property was acquired by the trust and the trustees, calling upon them within a period of thirty days specified in the notice, to explain the source of money or other assets out of or by means of which such property was acquired or, as the case may be, the source of money or other assets which were contributed to the trust for acquiring such property and thereupon such notice shall be deemed to be a notice served under section 58H and all the other provisions of this Chapter shall apply accordingly.

Explanation.—For the purposes of this section “illegally acquired property” in relation to any property held in trust, includes—
