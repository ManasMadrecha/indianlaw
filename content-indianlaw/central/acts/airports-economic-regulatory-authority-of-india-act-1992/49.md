chapter: 7
---

(1) If, at any time, the Central Government is of opinion—

(a) that on account of a grave emergency, the Authority is unable to discharge the functions and duties imposed on it by or under the provisions of this Act; or

(b) that the Authority has persistently made default in complying with any direction issued by the Central Government under this Act or in the discharge of the functions and duties imposed on it by or under the provisions of this Act and as a result of which default, the financial position of the Authority or the administration of any airport, heliport, airstrip, civil enclave or aeronautical communication station has deteriorated; or

(c) that circumstances exist which render it necessary in the public interest so to do, the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, supersede the Authority for such period, not exceeding six months, as may be specified in the notification:

Provided that before issuing a notification under this sub-section for the reasons mentioned in clause (b), the Central Government shall give a reasonable opportunity to the Authority to show cause as to why it should not be superseded and shall consider the explanations and objections, if any, of the Authority.

-----

(2) Upon the publication of a notification under sub-section (1) superseding the Authority,—

(a) all the Members shall, as from the date of supersession, vacate their offices as such;

(b) all the powers, functions and duties which may, by or under the provisions of this Act, be exercised or discharged by or on behalf of the Authority, shall until the Authority is re-constituted under sub-section (3), be exercised and discharged by such person or persons as the Central Government may direct;

(c) all property owned or controlled by the Authority shall, until the Authority is re-constituted under sub-section (3), vest in the Central Government.

-----

(3) On the expiration of the period of supersession specified in the notification issued under subsection (1), the Central Government may,—

(a) extend the period of supersession for such further term not exceeding six months, as it may consider necessary; or

(b) re-constitute the Authority by fresh appointment and in such case the Members who vacated their offices under clause (a) of sub-section (2) shall not be deemed disqualified for appointment:

Provided that the Central Government may, at any time before the expiration of the period of supersession, whether as originally specified under sub-section (1) or as extended under this sub-section, take action under clause (b) of this sub-section.

-----

(4) The Central Government shall cause a notification issued under sub-section (1) and a full report of any action taken under this section and the circumstances leading to such action to be laid before both Houses of Parliament at the earliest opportunity.
